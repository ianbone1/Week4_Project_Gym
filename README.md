### Gym

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### Inspired By

[Glofox](https://www.glofox.com/club-solution/), [Pike13](https://www.pike13.com/pike13-scheduling-software-demo)

#### Caution

You might try to create a Ruby class named `Class` - this is a reserved word in Ruby, so you will have to name your class `GymClass`, or similar.
