### Spending Tracker

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

Inspired by:
Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

### User Stories / Acceptance Criteria - MVP:

_As a user_
_I want to be able to specify who I am spending money with_
_So that I can track who I frequently shop with_

**Acceptance Criteria:** The user should be able to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail


_As a user_
_I want to be able to use tags to categorise my spending_
_So that I can easily see what I’m spending money on_

**Acceptance Criteria:** The user should be able to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport


_As a user_
_I want to be able to add tags, merchants, and amount spent to transactions_
_So that I can easily view full details about a transaction_

**Acceptance Criteria:**  The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.


_As a user_
_I want to be able to view all of my transactions in a single view_
_So that I can easily view the full details of all of my transactions in one place._

**Acceptance Criteria:** The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.



### User Stories - Possible Extensions:

_As a user_
_I want to see the time of the transaction_
_So that I can see when it took place._

**Acceptance Criteria:**  Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.

_As a user_
_I want to be able to set a budget on my app_
_So that I don’t overspend._

**Acceptance Criteria:**  The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.


_As a user_
_I want to view my transactions based on month/category etc…_
_So that I can get a clearer view of my outgoings over a specific period/to a specific category._

**Acceptance Criteria:** The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
